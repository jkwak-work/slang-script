# Cursor Rules for Shader-Slang Project
# This file ensures all AI assistance follows the project's CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines

## General behavior
- ALWAYS read and follow the CONTRIBUTING.md file in this repository. All suggestions, code changes, and recommendations must comply with the contribution guidelines specified in that document.
- Reference SLANG_PROJECT_MEMORY.md. If not present, copy from ../SLANG_PROJECT_MEMORY.md
- Always update SLANG_PROJECT_MEMORY.md as needed

## Build System Requirements
- Use CMake with the project's presets
- For CMake configuration, use `cmake --preset default --fresh`
- For building, use `cmake --build --preset release` or `cmake --build --preset debug`
- For more detailed build information, refer to docs/building.md

## Testing Requirements
- Always run `slang-test` from repository root directory
- Reference the slang-test document, tools/slang-test/README.md
- Reference the "Test Slang" section in .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Any changes made for the current issue should not cause a regression with slang-test.
- When there are regressions with slang-test, it is most likely the case where the current fix is still not an ideal solution yet.

## Coding convention
- When making code changes, follow the coding convention, docs/design/coding-conventions.md

## Debugging methods
- Because LLM is not able to use a debugger, it will be best to add printf logs.
- Keep the printf logs as much as possible in order to be already ready for additional requests from the user

## Slang specific syntax and features
- Reference the slang specific syntax and features described in the user guide documents under docs/user-guide
